# Python Functions and Conditionals
## Different Python functions to help solve simple and complex problems
These are Python programs I create to help solve problems faster. Any of these programs can be imported as a module.
They can used as sub-functions to a larger function.
I will keep building into these programs until I achieve the best versions.
I would appreciate a better suggestion.
Feel free to copy and use these functions for free.
